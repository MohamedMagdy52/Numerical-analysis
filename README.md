# Numerical analysis
This folder contains some numerical analysis projects.

## 1st: Lagrange interpolation

This code basically takes some values for x and y (points on xy plane) **as an input**.

The **output** can be in three forms based on the user's choice:
1. the best equation that passes through these points
> the degree of the equation is the number_of_points -1
2. the value of y based some input x
3. the value of x based some input y

## 2nd: Newton's forward method
Fisrt it generentes the difference table, then the newton's forward polynomial

##3rd: Newton's backward method
Fisrt it generentes the difference table, then the newton's backward polynomial

## 4th: curve fitting (polynomial)
Takes some values for x and y (points on xy plane) **as an input**.
The degree of the desired output polynomial **as an input**.
The form of the desired polynomial **as an input**.
  > ex) a*x**2 + b*x + c

The coefficients of the polynomial **as an output**.

## 5th: curve fitting (exponential)
Takes some values for x and y (points on xy plane) **as an input**.
generate the coefficients (a and b) of the equation in the form: y=ae^(bx) **as an output**.

## 6th: curve fitting (power)
Takes some values for x and y (points on xy plane) **as an input**.
generate the coefficients (a and b) of the equation in the form of:
1. y = ab^x
2. y = ax^b
based on the user choice
**as an output**
